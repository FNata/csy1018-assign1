            <h1>ABOUT FLORENCE <p>'Self-taught, Determined Tech Lover, - Code Enthusiastic'</p></h1>

            <h3>
          I am a full-time student seeking a part-time position in the retail sector. I am currently studying a BEng in Computing (Computer Systems Engineering). I would like to assume employment in the retail sector to build my practical work experience and to help develop my skill set. I am confident that I can offer my employer an employee who is hardworking, a fast leaner and keen to develop personally and professionally. My eventual career goal is to work within the field of Technology and focusing on how I could contribute to its development.
        </h3>
            <h3>Few examples, of my work during my placement week at EE's Digital Department. This supports my quote at the top, as it shows that i am interested in technology.</h3>
