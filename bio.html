          I am a full-time student seeking a part-time position in the retail sector. I am currently studying a BEng in Computing (Computer Systems Engineering). I would like to assume employment in the retail sector to build my practical work experience and to help develop my skill set. I am confident that I can offer my employer an employee who is hardworking, a fast leaner and keen to develop personally and professionally. My eventual career goal is to work within the field of Technology and focusing on how I could contribute to its development.
